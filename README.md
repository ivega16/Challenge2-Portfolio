# 02 Portfolio

## Description

My motivation was to create a personal webpage that could host my portfolio. I built this project because I wanted to find a way to put my work on display in a creative way. This problem solves a scattered portfolio; the webpage consolidates my projects and makes them more accessible. I learned how to create an aplication using HTML and CSS.
